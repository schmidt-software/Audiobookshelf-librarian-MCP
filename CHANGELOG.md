# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Security
- MCP authentication is now actually enforced. Previously `MCP_TOKEN` was only copied into an
  unused `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable, so every tool was reachable without credentials.
  All MCP HTTP requests now require `Authorization: Bearer <MCP_TOKEN>` (constant-time
  comparison) and are rejected with HTTP 401 otherwise; `/health` stays public.
- Fail closed: the server refuses to start when `MCP_TOKEN` is empty, and the auth layer rejects
  every MCP request (HTTP 503) if it is ever constructed without a token.

## [0.2.11] - 2026-06-12

### Added
- `delete_item` tool: delete a single ABS item record by ID (dry-run by default, requires confirm=True)

## [0.2.10] - 2026-06-12

### Fixed
- `list_missing` and `purge_missing`: ABS filter API for `issues.missing` does not work reliably.
  Replaced with client-side filtering: fetch all items and filter by `isMissing` flag, which is
  the same approach used by `library_overview` (confirmed accurate).

## [0.2.9] - 2026-06-12

### Fixed
- `library_overview` series count now derived from `seriesName` strings on items (same as
  authors), replacing the broken `get_series()` endpoint call which returned 0 results.
  Series names are deduplicated by stripping the sequence suffix (e.g. "Series #3" → "Series").

## [0.2.8] - 2026-06-12

### Fixed
- `list_missing` and `purge_missing`: ABS filter format is `{group}.{base64(value)}` not
  `base64("{group}.{value}")` — fixed to `"issues." + base64("missing")`

## [0.2.7] - 2026-06-12

### Fixed
- `library_overview` and `find_items` now correctly read authors and series from the ABS list
  endpoint, which returns minified metadata using `authorName`/`seriesName` strings rather than
  `authors`/`series` arrays (those are only in the expanded single-item response)
- `library_overview` series count now uses the dedicated `/api/libraries/{id}/series` endpoint
- Removed ineffective `include=authors,series` parameter that was not a valid ABS API option

## [0.2.6] - 2026-06-12

### Fixed
- `set_cover` no longer crashes when ABS search_covers returns a list of URL strings instead of dicts

## [0.2.5] - 2026-06-12

### Fixed
- `scan_library` and `quick_match` no longer crash on non-JSON ABS responses (all HTTP methods now use try/except around `.json()`)
- `tool_fs_move` and `tool_fs_quarantine` no longer crash with duplicate `dry_run` kwarg in `log_operation` call
- `tool_fs_tree` no longer returns oversized responses — audio file lists suppressed at all depths (counts still shown)

## [0.2.4] - 2026-06-12

### Fixed
- `list_missing` and `purge_missing` now correctly filter missing items by base64-encoding the ABS filter parameter (`issues.missing`)

## [0.2.3] - 2026-06-12

### Fixed
- `find_items` and `library_overview` now return authors and series correctly by passing `include=authors,series` to the ABS library items endpoint
